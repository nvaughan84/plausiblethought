# About me

Hi there, I'm [Marc](http://www.marcjenkins.co.uk) and this is my blog. 

I live with my wife, [Julie](http://twitter.com/mejulie_xx), and our labrador, Meg, in not-so-sunny Redditch, UK.

I'm a front-end developer for a small online marketing agency in Birmingham called [The Blue Cube](http://www.thebluecube.com). I'm an experienced WordPress developer and have worked with other platforms including Shopify, Expression Engine, MODx, Perch and Kirby.

I can usually be found [tweeting](http://www.twitter.com/marcjenkins) about Formula One, Apple or heavy metal music.
