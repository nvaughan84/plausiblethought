I want to write with the elegance and sophistication of Orwell; with the charm and whit of Dickens. Yet I want to write in a style of my own.

I want to write to inspire; to educate and inform.

I want to write without frills. With clarity and confidence.

And that is why I write not at all.

I am my own worse critic. Nothing is perfect yet nothing is further from perfection than my own writing.

From this day forward I will write to get better. Perfect is forever out of reach but the act of doing will surely get me closer.
