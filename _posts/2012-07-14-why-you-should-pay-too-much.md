Allen Tucker:

> Have you ever inherited something that’s really old?  When you held it, did you notice that it’s different than what you can buy at the store today?  Chances are your grandparents saved up for quite some time to buy it, and that’s why it’s lasted until now.

> Often something that costs twice as much doesn’t perform twice as long, it lasts ten times longer.
