[Trent Walton](http://trentwalton.com/) (who, along with the team at [Paravel](http://paravelinc.com/), helped design & buid the new Microsoft homepage) wrote a great piece on the redesign of [microsoft.com](http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/default.aspx). I particularly like this bit:

> This week’s launch marks a momentous step for Microsoft and for responsive web design. Rather than waiting for the greater web community to clearly hash out best RWD practices, Microsoft has jumped in early, joining us in the trenches with an abundance of resources and zeal. Thank you, Microsoft—for demonstrating that RWD is the future of the web and that businesses of any size are capable of adopting the approach.

Are we going to see more large corporations join the responsive web movement? [Currys](http://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/index.html) also went responsive recently.
