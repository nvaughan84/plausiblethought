[Helvetica](http://www.helveticafilm.com/) is an extraordinarily well-made documentary film by Gary Hustwit about ‘typography, graphic design and global visual culture’. It’s a wonderful look at the typeface and explores just how ubiquitous it has become.

It‘s well worth a watch if you are interested in design and typography. I watched it via [iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/movie/helvetica/id284740710), but it’s also available on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Helvetica-David-Carson/dp/B000VWEFP8).

Helvetica is Gary Hustwit’s first film in the ‘design trilogy’. There’s also [Objectified](http://www.objectifiedfilm.com/), which focuses on industrial design/product design and the relationship with the manufactured objects that surround us. And [Urbanized](http://urbanizedfilm.com/), which looks at the issues and strategies behind urban design. Both of which are on my list of films to watch.
