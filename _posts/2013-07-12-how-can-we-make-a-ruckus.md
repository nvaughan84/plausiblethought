Seth Godin:

> Itâ€™s important because why else are we here? 

> We won the lottery. We have the right parents, we were born in the right decade, we are the wealthiest generation in the history of mankind. We have better healthcare, better opportunities, better connection than has ever been before and *maybe* will ever be again.

> You could waste it if you want to. 

> You could watch a little more TV or slag a few more people on Twitter. I think we can do better than that. 

> For me, as someone who cares about what we do when we are at our best, it feels to me we are at our best not when we consume or spectate but we are at our best when we produce and innovate.

I found this gem on a recent episode of the [Happy Monday podcast](http://www.happymondaypodcast.com/episodes/seth-godin). Great quote, great podcast.
