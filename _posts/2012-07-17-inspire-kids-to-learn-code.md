[Code Club](http://codeclub.org.uk/) is an after school coding club for children aged 10-11. Like the [two co-founders](http://codeclub.org.uk/#about), I also share the belief that it is essential that children are introduced to coding at an early age and shown how much fun it can be.

Spread the word: you can follow Code Club on Twitter ([@codeclub](http://twitter.com/codeclub)) and your local school can [sign up on their website](http://codeclub.org.uk/#schools).
